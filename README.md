#SSP-03-001-HelloExpress

* Initialised app using "npm init"
* Added .gitignore file to ignore all files within the node_modules folder (As I don't need to store packages that will be required by my app anyway)
* Installed the Express module and saved this as a dependancy "npm install express --save"
